Dockerfile and docker-compose files to use as development environments.

I have multiple computers and can use these to work on projects instead of setting up a development environment on each one.

Local PC requirements:

Docker or Docker Desktop installed.
Git installed.
Microsoft VS Code installed. Remote-Containers extension installed.

Use 'docker-compose up -d' to start a container. Connect to the container using VS Code.
